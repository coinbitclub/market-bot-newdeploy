# GEO-BLOCKING SOLUTIONS

## Problem
Your production server (Render.com) is in a region that both Binance and Bybit block.

## Solutions (Ranked by Difficulty)

### 1. Use a VPN/Proxy Service (Recommended)
Add a proxy to your exchange API requests:

**Pros:**
- Keep using Render.com
- Relatively easy to implement
- Can choose proxy location

**Cons:**
- Additional cost ($5-20/month)
- Slight latency increase
- Need to manage proxy reliability

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In binance-service.js and bybit-service.js
const HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

const axiosConfig = {
  httpsAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL)
};
```

**Proxy Services:**
- Bright Data (residential proxies)
- Oxylabs
- ScraperAPI
- Luminati

### 2. Move to a Different Hosting Region
Deploy to a server in an allowed region:

**Options:**
- Render.com (different region)
- AWS EC2 (Tokyo, Singapore)
- DigitalOcean (Singapore, India)
- Heroku (Europe region)

**How to check allowed regions:**
1. Binance: Generally allows most Asia-Pacific, Europe (non-US)
2. Bybit: Similar to Binance

---

### 3. IP Whitelisting (If Available)
Check if exchanges allow IP whitelisting:

**Binance:**
- Go to API Management → Edit API → API Restrictions
- Add your production server IP
- Note: This won't work if region is completely blocked

**Bybit:**
- Go to API → Edit → IP Access Restriction
- Add your production server IP

---

### 4. Hybrid Approach (Quick Fix)
Keep exchange API calls on localhost, expose via webhook:

**Architecture:**
```
Frontend → Production API → Webhook to Localhost → Exchange APIs
```

**Pros:**
- No server migration needed
- Works immediately

**Cons:**
- Localhost must be always running
- Need to expose localhost to internet (ngrok/tunneling)

---

## Recommended Immediate Action

1. **Test with a simple proxy first:**
   - Sign up for a free trial of a proxy service
   - Add to your Render.com environment variables
   - Test if it resolves the issue

2. **If proxy works:**
   - Subscribe to a paid plan
   - Update production deployment

3. **Long term:**
   - Consider moving to a better-located server
   - Or implement a multi-region failover system

## Checking Your Current Server Location

```bash
# SSH into Render.com and run:
curl ipinfo.io
```

This will show your server's IP and location.

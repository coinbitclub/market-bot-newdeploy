# API CALL COMPARISON ANALYSIS
==================================================

## Test Script (WORKS)
```javascript
API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3333'
URL: ${API_BASE_URL}/api/user-settings/all-balances
Headers: { Authorization: Bearer ${token} }
```

## Frontend (DOESN'T WORK)
```typescript
API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3333'
URL: ${API_BASE_URL}/api/user-settings/all-balances
Headers: { Authorization: Bearer ${token} } (via interceptor)
```

## Key Question:
**Are both calling the SAME backend URL?**

If frontend .env has:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3333` → Calls localhost
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://marketbot-backend-ixpu.onrender.com` → Calls production

The test script calls: ${API_BASE_URL from .env}
The frontend calls: ${API_BASE_URL from .env}

## Most Likely Issue:
The user showed production API response earlier with $0.00 balances.
This suggests:
1. Frontend is calling PRODUCTION backend
2. Test script is calling LOCALHOST backend
3. Localhost has the fix (decryption)
4. Production doesn't have the fix yet (needs deploy)

## Solution:
Deploy the updated backend code to production!
